            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Pablo Blanco López and I am a student of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Granada. 
                I am passionate about technology and I am always looking for new challenges to improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an example, I build this page alone, with Oracle Cloud VPS and LAMP, getting a free domain and a SSL certificate. 
                I started the idea since I saw on Instagram some influencers sponsoring their LinkTree, a site to group all your useful links to share them in your bio. 
                When I saw that, I thought that I could do something similar, but with my own domain and my own server.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently looking for an internship to put into practice all the knowledge I have acquired during my studies. 
                I am a proactive person, with a great capacity for teamwork and a great desire to learn.
